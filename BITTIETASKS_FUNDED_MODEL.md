# BittieTasks Self-Funded Task Model

## Concept: Platform-Sponsored Tasks

**Model**: BittieTasks creates and funds tasks directly, paying users from platform revenue rather than relying on corporate partnerships or neighbor payments.

**Example**:
- BittieTasks posts: "Complete a 30-minute walk in your neighborhood - $15"
- User completes task, submits photo proof
- BittieTasks pays $15 directly from platform funds
- No corporate sponsor, no neighbor payment required
