# Safe Stripe Setup - Won't Break Your Code

## DON'T WORRY - SETUP IS SAFE

The Stripe account setup is **completely separate** from your code. Here's what's safe to do:

## ‚úÖ **SAFE TO COMPLETE** (Won't affect your code):

### Account Information
- Business name, address, phone
- Tax ID and business type  
- Personal identification
- Bank account for payouts

### Verification Documents
- Upload ID documents
- Business registration papers
- Tax forms (W-9, etc.)

### Settings You Can Change
- Payout schedule (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Statement descriptor (what shows on customer cards)
- Email notifications
- Dashboard users and permissions

## ‚ùå **DON'T TOUCH THESE** (Could affect integration):

### API Keys Section
- **Don't regenerate** your existing API keys
- **Don't create new** restricted keys  
- Keep your current `pk_live_` and `sk_live_` keys

### Webhooks Section
- **Don't modify** existing webhook endpoints
- **Don't disable** webhooks

### Products & Pricing  
- **Don't delete** your existing price IDs:
  - Pro: `price_1Rxbut2ZO7WvKXeTgo1nNSIE`
  - Premium: `price_1Rxbxh2ZO7WvKXeTC6IoCqXD`

## üéØ **FOCUS ON THESE STEPS**:

1. **Complete business verification**
2. **Add bank account for payouts** 
3. **Submit tax information**
4. **Upload required documents**

## RESULT:
Once you complete setup, your account will show "Activated" and subscriptions will work immediately with zero code changes needed.

**Continue with confidence - the account setup won't break anything I've built!**
