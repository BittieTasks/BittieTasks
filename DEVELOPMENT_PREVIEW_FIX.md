# Development Preview Fix Implementation

## Issue Diagnosed
The development preview was failing due to:
1. Hydration mismatches in complex auth logic
2. Client-side routing conflicts  
3. Cross-origin issues with Replit preview

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simplified Homepage Component
- Removed complex auth state management from homepage
- Created `SafeWelcomePage` with static HTML structure
- Eliminated hydration issues by removing client-side state

### 2. Next.js Configuration Updates
- Added proper CORS headers
- Fixed asset prefix for development
- Added cache control headers for preview reliability
- Configured allowed origins for server actions

### 3. Error Boundaries & Loading States
- Added `app/error.tsx` for graceful error handling
- Added `app/loading.tsx` for loading states
- Implemented proper fallback components

### 4. Routing Improvements
- Replaced `window.location.href` with Next.js router
- Simplified navigation flow
- Added static anchor links as fallbacks

## Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Simplified homepage
- `components/SafeWelcomePage.tsx` - New stable component
- `next.config.js` - Fixed preview configuration
- `app/error.tsx` - Added error boundary
- `app/loading.tsx` - Added loading state

## Result
The development preview should now work reliably with:
- ✅ Clean teal design theme
- ✅ Friendly button language
- ✅ Proper currency display ($ symbols)
- ✅ Stable rendering without hydration issues
- ✅ Replit preview compatibility
