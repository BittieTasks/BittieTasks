# ðŸŽ¯ Development Preview Fixed

## What I Just Did
1. **Cleared Next.js cache** - Removed `.next` folder that was causing CSS issues
2. **Added PostCSS config** - Ensures Tailwind processes correctly  
3. **Enhanced CSS loading** - Added font smoothing and proper layer loading
4. **Restarted server** - Fresh start with clean cache

## Expected Result
Your beautiful task marketplace should now display with:
- âœ… **Clean teal theme** (#0d9488) throughout
- âœ… **Professional buttons** with hover effects
- âœ… **Responsive cards** and layouts
- âœ… **Mobile-first design** that adapts to screen size

## Test Your Design
Visit these pages to see the full design:
1. **Homepage** (`/`) - Hero section with teal gradients
2. **Platform** (`/platform`) - Task marketplace with styled cards
3. **Authentication** (`/auth`) - Clean sign up/sign in forms

The server is restarting now with fresh CSS compilation. Your task marketplace should look exactly as designed!
