# Database Setup Guide

## Step 1: Remove Sample Data
I've removed all demo/sample data from the APIs. Your marketplace now connects only to the real Supabase database.

## Step 2: Set Up Database Schema
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the complete schema in `scripts/setup-database.sql`

This creates:
- **profiles** table for user information
- **categories** table with 8 parent-focused categories
- **tasks** table for community tasks
- **task_participants** table for applications
- **transactions** table for payments
- **Row Level Security** policies for data protection
- **Automatic triggers** for user profile creation and participant counting

## Step 3: Test Real Functionality
After running the SQL:
1. Sign up for a new account - profile automatically created
2. Create real tasks through the platform
3. Apply to tasks with real application flow
4. All data persisted in your database

## Current State
- APIs now return empty arrays until database is set up
- No sample data - only real user-generated content
- Authentication working with proper profile creation
- Ready for production use once database schema is applied

Your marketplace will be completely real - no demo data, only actual user tasks and applications.
