# SMTP Configuration Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ SendGrid API working (test emails sent successfully)
- ✅ SendGrid sender verified (noreply@bittietasks.com)
- ⏳ Supabase SMTP configuration applied
- ❓ Testing complete signup flow

## If Still Getting Rate Limits

### 1. Wait for Changes to Apply
Supabase SMTP changes can take 5-10 minutes to take effect. This is normal.

### 2. Verify SMTP Settings in Supabase
Double-check these exact values in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP Port: 587
SMTP User: apikey
SMTP Pass: [Your SendGrid API Key]
SMTP Admin Email: noreply@bittietasks.com
```

### 3. Check Email Confirmations
Make sure "Enable email confirmations" is turned ON in Supabase Auth settings.

### 4. SendGrid Domain Authentication (Optional)
For production, consider setting up domain authentication in SendGrid for better deliverability.

## What Success Looks Like
When working correctly:
- Friends can signup without rate limit errors
- They receive verification emails from noreply@bittietasks.com
- Emails are delivered via SendGrid (check SendGrid activity dashboard)

## Next Steps
1. Wait 5-10 minutes if you just saved SMTP settings
2. Test signup flow again
3. Check SendGrid activity dashboard for email delivery
