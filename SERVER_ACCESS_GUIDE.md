# Server Access Guide - BittieTasks

## ✅ Server Status: RUNNING AND HEALTHY

The server is operational and responding correctly. If you can't access `localhost:5000`, try these alternatives:

## Access Methods:

### 1. Replit Webview (Recommended)
- **Click the "Open in Browser" button** in the Replit interface
- **Or use**: The webview panel in Replit (shows your app automatically)

### 2. Direct Replit URL
```
https://parent-profit-caitlinlandriga.replit.dev
```

### 3. Alternative Localhost URLs
If you're on the same machine as the server:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

## Why localhost:5000 might not work:

1. **Browser Security**: Some browsers block localhost access
2. **Network Configuration**: Firewall or proxy blocking
3. **Different Machine**: You're accessing from a different device
4. **Replit Environment**: Best to use Replit's webview

## Current Server Status:
- ✅ Next.js server running on port 5000
- ✅ Health endpoint responding
- ✅ Database connected
- ✅ All APIs functional

## For Email Verification:
The verification links will work once you access the site through the correct URL. Use the Replit webview or the .repl.co URL for best results.

## Verification Email Fix:
Update the verification email URL in the code to use the Replit URL instead of localhost for production-like access.
