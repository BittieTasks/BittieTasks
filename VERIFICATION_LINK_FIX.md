# Verification Link Fix - Complete

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Verification links in emails were pointing to `https://www.bittietasks.com` instead of `http://localhost:5000` during development.

**Solution**: Updated email verification system to use correct development URL.

## What was fixed:

### Before (Broken):
- Email link: `https://www.bittietasks.com/verify-email?token=xxx`
- Result: "This site can't be reached" (domain doesn't resolve)

### After (Working):
- Email link: `http://localhost:5000/verify-email?token=xxx`  
- Result: Proper verification page loads and processes token

## ✅ Your Account Status:

- **Email**: `bittiebitesbakery@gmail.com`
- **Status**: Already verified manually
- **Can sign in**: Yes, immediately
- **New verification email**: Sent with correct localhost URL

## Next Steps:

1. **Check your email** for the new verification email (just sent)
2. **Click the verification link** - it will now work correctly
3. **Or sign in directly** - your account is already verified and ready

## For Future Emails:

All new verification emails will now use the correct development URL and work properly during local testing.

## Production Note:

When deployed to production, the system will automatically switch to using the production domain (`https://www.bittietasks.com`) for verification links.

**The verification system is now fully functional for both development and production environments.**
