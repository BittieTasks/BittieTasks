# ðŸš€ Alternative Deployment Options - Get Your Revenue Platform Live

## Since the Deploy Button is Hard to Find:

### Option 1: Check if Project Already Exists
- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Look for "BittieTasks" in your projects list
- If it exists, click on it
- Look for "Visit" or "View" button for the live URL

### Option 2: Create New Import
- Click **"Add New..."** (top right)
- Select **"Project"**
- Under "Import Git Repository"
- Find "BittieTasks" and click **"Import"**
- This should open the configuration page with Deploy button at bottom

### Option 3: Alternative - Use Netlify Instead
Much simpler process:
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your project folder
3. Or connect GitHub repository
4. Automatic deployment in 2 minutes

### Option 4: Check Current Vercel Interface
Sometimes the interface changes:
- Look for **"Deploy"**, **"Create"**, or **"Build"** button
- Might be labeled **"Import and Deploy"**
- Could be at top right instead of bottom
