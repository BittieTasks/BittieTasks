# Stripe Account Activation Check

## Your Keys Are Standard - But Account May Need Activation

Since you have standard keys (`pk_live_` publishable key confirms this), the issue is likely:

### **Most Likely: Account Not Fully Activated**

Even with valid live keys, your Stripe account might not be fully activated for live payments.

## Quick Checks:

### 1. **Account Activation Status**
Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account
- Look for any red warnings or "Complete setup" messages
- Check if there are missing required fields
- Verify business information is complete

### 2. **Account Requirements**
Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/requirements
- See if any documents or information are missing
- Complete any pending requirements

### 3. **Payment Processing Enabled**
In your Stripe dashboard, verify:
- ✅ "Charges enabled" = Yes
- ✅ "Payouts enabled" = Yes

## Common Issues:

1. **Business verification pending** - Need to submit business documents
2. **Bank account not verified** - Need to verify payout bank account  
3. **Missing tax information** - Need to complete tax forms
4. **Address verification** - Business address needs verification

## Test Your Account:

After checking the above, test the subscription button again:
1. Go to: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click subscription button
4. Check for new error messages

The enhanced logging will now show specific Stripe error codes that indicate exactly what needs to be completed.

## Expected Fix:
Complete any missing account requirements in Stripe dashboard, then subscriptions should work immediately.
