# BittieTasks Functionality Issues - DIAGNOSIS

## Problem Summary
You're authenticated but can't use core features because API calls are failing due to authentication token issues.

## Root Cause: Authentication Token Flow
- **Authentication works**: You can log in successfully
- **API calls fail**: Components aren't passing authentication tokens properly
- **Result**: You appear logged in but can't subscribe, create tasks, or apply for tasks

## Specific Issues Found:

### 1. Subscription Page
- `/subscribe` loads but "Subscribe" buttons don't work
- Missing Authorization headers in API calls to `/api/create-subscription`

### 2. Task Categories
- Solo, Community, Barter, Corporate sections show empty or error
- API calls to `/api/tasks` failing due to missing auth tokens

### 3. Task Creation/Application
- Forms load but submission fails
- Authentication tokens not being passed to backend APIs

## SendGrid Impact: MINIMAL
- SendGrid free trial only affects email verification
- Does NOT affect core functionality like subscriptions or tasks
- Email verification bypass already exists at `/dev-verify`

## Fix Required: Authentication Token Flow
Need to ensure all API calls include proper Authorization headers with the user's session token.

## Status: TECHNICAL ISSUE - Not Business/Service Issue
This is a code integration problem, not a fundamental platform failure.
