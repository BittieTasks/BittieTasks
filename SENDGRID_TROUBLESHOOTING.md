# SendGrid Troubleshooting - Sender Mismatch Issue

## Current Problem
- SendGrid dashboard shows "everything verified"
- But API still returns 403 Forbidden error
- Error message: "Please verify noreply@em9217.wwwbittietasks.com"

## Root Cause
There's likely a mismatch between:
1. **What's verified in SendGrid**: Your actual verified sender
2. **What our code uses**: `noreply@em9217.wwwbittietasks.com`

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Verified Senders
In SendGrid Dashboard:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Sender Authentication
2. Look at "Single Sender Verification" section
3. Check what email addresses are actually verified

### Step 2: Common Verified Senders
You likely have one of these verified:
- `noreply@bittietasks.com`
- `your-email@gmail.com` 
- `support@bittietasks.com`
- A different variation of the domain

### Step 3: Update Code to Match
Tell me exactly what email address shows as "Verified" in your SendGrid dashboard, and I'll update the code to use that address.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Use Your Personal Email (Temporary)
If you verified a personal email like gmail.com, I can update the code to use that for now.

### Option B: Match Verified Domain
If you have a domain verified, I'll update to use the exact format that's verified.

### Option C: Add New Single Sender
Create a new single sender verification for the exact address our code uses.

## What I Need From You
Please check your SendGrid dashboard and tell me:
1. In "Single Sender Verification" - what email addresses show "Verified"?
2. In "Domain Authentication" - what domains show "Verified"?

Then I'll update the code to match exactly what's verified.
