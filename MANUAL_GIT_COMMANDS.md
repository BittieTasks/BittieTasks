# ðŸ”§ Manual Git Commands - Run These in Shell

## The git repository has lock files. Run these commands manually in Replit Shell:

### Step 1: Remove Lock Files
```bash
rm -f .git/config.lock
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Connection
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/BittieTasks/BittieTasks.git
```

### Step 3: Add All Files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 4: Commit Your Platform
```bash
git commit -m "Complete BittieTasks monetization platform ready for deployment"
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## If Step 2 Still Fails:
Try this alternative:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/BittieTasks/BittieTasks.git
```

## Expected Result:
After successful push:
- Your GitHub repository will have all the BittieTasks files
- Vercel will automatically start deploying
- Your revenue platform will be live in 2-3 minutes

Run these commands one by one in the Shell tab and let me know if any errors occur!
