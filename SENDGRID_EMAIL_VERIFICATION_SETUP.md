# SendGrid Email Verification Setup - FINAL CONFIGURATION

## Current Status: ✅ Domain Verified (`em9217.wwwbittietasks.com`)

Your SendGrid domain is verified! Now you need to update Supabase to use the correct sender email.

## REQUIRED: Update Supabase SMTP Settings

You need to change the sender email in Supabase to use your verified SendGrid domain:

### Go back to Supabase SMTP Settings:
1. **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj
2. **Navigate to**: Authentication → Settings → SMTP Settings
3. **Change the sender email to**: `noreply@em9217.wwwbittietasks.com`
4. **Keep everything else the same**:
   - Host: `smtp.sendgrid.net`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: `apikey`
   - Password: [Your SendGrid API Key]
   - Sender name: `BittieTasks`

### Why This Matters:
- SendGrid only allows emails from your verified domain (`em9217.wwwbittietasks.com`)
- Using `noreply@bittietasks.com` would be rejected as unverified
- Using `noreply@em9217.wwwbittietasks.com` will work immediately

### 2. API Key Permissions (Should be fine)
Your SendGrid API key needs these permissions:
- ✅ Mail Send (required)
- ✅ Mail Send Settings (recommended)

## Test the Email Verification:
1. **Go to your app**: Sign up with a real email address
2. **Check your email**: Should receive verification email
3. **Click the link**: Should redirect and verify your account
4. **Check Supabase logs**: Authentication → Logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting:
If emails aren't sending:
- **Check SendGrid Activity**: Dashboard → Activity → see if emails are being sent
- **Check Supabase Logs**: Authentication → Logs for SMTP errors
- **Verify sender**: Make sure your sender email/domain is authenticated

## Most Likely Issue:
If it's not working, it's probably **sender authentication** - SendGrid requires verified senders to prevent spam.
