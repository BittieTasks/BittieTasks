# üö® URGENT: CRITICAL SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## Immediate Action Required
**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY DETECTED**: Table `public.verification_tokens` is accessible without Row Level Security (RLS).

## Security Risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User verification tokens exposed publicly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email verification system compromised  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential unauthorized access to user authentication data

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj
2. Navigate to: **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click: **New Query**

### Step 2: Run This SQL Command
```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security on verification_tokens
ALTER TABLE public.verification_tokens ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policy to only allow users to access their own verification tokens
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own verification tokens" 
ON public.verification_tokens 
FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.verification_tokens TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.verification_tokens TO service_role;
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix Applied
Run this to confirm RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'verification_tokens';
```
Should return: `rowsecurity = true`

## After Applying Fix
1. ‚úÖ Test email verification still works
2. ‚úÖ Verify users can only access their own tokens
3. ‚úÖ Confirm authentication flow is secure

## Status: 
üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Apply immediately
üü° **TESTING** - Verify after fix
üü¢ **SECURE** - RLS enabled and working

**This security fix must be applied immediately to protect user data.**
