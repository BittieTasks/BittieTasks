# BittieTasks Deployment Status - GitHub Integration

## Current Status
- Local application: Working perfectly (Next.js 15.4.6 running on port 5000)
- Temporary Vercel deployment: Successful (all 16 pages built)
- Main domain: Needs updated configuration from GitHub

## Files Ready for GitHub Push
1. `vercel.json` - Fixed environment variables and runtime configuration
2. `app/platform/page.tsx` - JSX syntax errors resolved
3. `deploy.sh` - Deployment automation script
4. Various deployment configuration files

## Deployment Pipeline
GitHub → Vercel Auto-Deploy → BittieTasks.com

## Next Steps
1. Clear git locks
2. Add and commit all deployment fixes
3. Push to GitHub main branch
4. Verify Vercel auto-deployment triggers
5. Confirm main domain builds successfully

## Expected Outcome
- GitHub will have the latest fixed code
- Vercel will automatically deploy from GitHub
- Main BittieTasks domain will work with all fixes applied
- All 16 pages will build successfully in production
