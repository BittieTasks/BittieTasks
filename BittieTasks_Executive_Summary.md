## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Market Problem:** 89 million American adults need flexible income opportunities, but existing gig platforms serve only specialized skills or require significant time commitments. Meanwhile, 40% of Americans can't cover a $400 emergency expense, and 35% report feeling lonely regularly.

**Solution:** BittieTasks is a mobile-first community task marketplace that transforms everyday activities into income opportunities while building stronger neighborhoods.
