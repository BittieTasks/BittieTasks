# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Issue: SENDGRID_API_KEY Missing in Production

The build is failing because Vercel doesn't have the SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable.

## Fix Options:

### Option 1: Add to Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your BittieTasks project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` with your SendGrid API key value
5. Redeploy

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env add SENDGRID_API_KEY
# Enter your SendGrid API key when prompted
vercel --prod
```

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Code fixed to handle missing API key gracefully
- ‚è≥ Need to add SENDGRID_API_KEY to Vercel environment
- üöÄ Ready for deployment once environment variable is set

## After Adding Environment Variable:
- Vercel build will succeed
- SendGrid integration will work in production
- Authentication emails will be delivered via SendGrid
