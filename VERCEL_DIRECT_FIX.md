# Direct Vercel Fix - Bypass GitHub Issues

## What I Just Did:
✅ **Removed problematic environment variable references** from vercel.json
✅ **Kept only the working public variables** (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
✅ **Private variables will be read from Vercel Dashboard** (where you added them)

## Updated vercel.json:
- Removed: `"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "@supabase-service-role-key"`
- Removed: `"SENDGRID_API_KEY": "@sendgrid-api-key"`
- These will be read from your Vercel environment variables instead

## Next Steps:
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find BittieTasks** → Deployments
3. **Click "Redeploy"** on latest deployment

## Why This Works:
- Your environment variables are correctly set in Vercel Dashboard
- vercel.json was trying to reference them with wrong format
- Direct deployment will use Dashboard environment variables
- Bypasses GitHub integration issues

## Expected Result:
✅ Vercel deployment will succeed
✅ Production signup will work: https://www.bittietasks.com/auth
✅ Environment variables will be properly loaded

**The manual Vercel redeploy should work immediately now.**
