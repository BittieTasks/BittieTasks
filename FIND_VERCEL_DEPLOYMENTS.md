# üîç How to Find Vercel Deployments

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. In Your Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Find your **"BittieTasks"** project
- Click on the project name (not the repository link)

### 2. Look for These Tabs:
- **Overview** (default view)
- **Deployments** (what we need)
- **Functions**
- **Analytics** 
- **Settings**

### 3. If You Don't See Deployments Tab:
- Make sure you clicked on the **project name**, not the GitHub link
- The tabs should be horizontal near the top
- Try refreshing the page

### 4. Alternative Ways to Check:
- **In Overview tab**: Recent deployments should show at the top
- **Project URL**: Look for a preview URL in the overview
- **Git Integration Status**: Check if GitHub is properly connected

### 5. What to Look For:
- ‚úÖ **Building** - Deployment in progress
- ‚úÖ **Ready** - Deployment successful with live URL
- ‚ùå **Error** - Build failed (check logs)

## If Still No Deployments:
The GitHub connection might need to be re-established. Let me know what you see in the Overview tab.
