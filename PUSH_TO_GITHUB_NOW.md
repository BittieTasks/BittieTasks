# ðŸš€ PUSH UPDATED DEPLOYMENT CONFIG TO GITHUB

## Current Issue
The Vercel CLI deployed to a temporary subdomain but your main domain still needs the fixed configuration.

## Files Updated with Fixes
- `vercel.json`: Fixed environment variables and runtime version
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment script
- `force-deploy.txt`: Deployment trigger

## Manual Git Commands Required

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clear any git locks
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/remotes/origin/main.lock

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the deployment fixes
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration and force redeploy

- Update vercel.json with direct environment variables instead of secret references
- Fix runtime version specification for @vercel/node
- Resolved JSX syntax errors in app/platform/page.tsx
- All 16 pages build successfully in production"

# Force push to trigger deployment on main domain
git push origin main --force
```

## Expected Result
Once pushed, your main BittieTasks domain should automatically redeploy with:
- Fixed JSX syntax errors
- Proper environment variables
- All 16 pages building successfully
- Professional UI working correctly

## Verification
Check that the deployment uses the latest commit and builds without errors.
