# Solo Task Banner Fix - Push Commands

## ✅ Fixed the Banner Issue

**Location:** Line 161-165 in `app/subscribe/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```
💡 Solo tasks are always FREE - BittieTasks pays you directly!
```

**After:**
```
💡 Solo tasks have a low 3% platform fee - transparent pricing!
```

## Push Commands

Run these in the Replit shell:

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add app/subscribe/page.tsx
git commit -m "Fix solo task banner - correct 3% fee messaging"
git push origin main
```

## Complete Solo Task Fee Fix Summary

Now ALL instances are corrected:
1. ✅ Subscription features: "Access to Solo tasks (3% platform fee)"
2. ✅ Fee breakdown section: "3% Solo Tasks - Platform fee" 
3. ✅ **Banner message: "Solo tasks have a low 3% platform fee"** ← JUST FIXED

The entire subscription page now correctly reflects the 3% fee structure for solo tasks with complete transparency.
