## Implementation Approach

### Database Schema Issue Found
The API endpoints have column name mismatches with the database schema. To properly implement these tasks, you'll need to either:

1. **Direct Database Access**: Add tasks directly through Supabase dashboard
2. **Fix API Schema**: Update the API routes to match database column names
3. **Use Admin Interface**: Create tasks through your admin panel

### Payment Structure Clarified

✅ **Peer-to-Peer Tasks**: Users pay each other directly, BittieTasks takes 7% platform fee
✅ **BittieTasks Funded**: Platform pays users directly for completed tasks (0% fee)
✅ **Verification System**: Photo/video proof triggers automatic payment release
✅ **Revenue Streams**: Mix of P2P community tasks and platform-sponsored activities
✅ **Payment Flow**: Task completion → Verification → Instant payment release

### Task Design Principles Applied

✅ **Inclusive & Accessible**: No childcare, suitable for all adults regardless of physical ability
✅ **Daily Focus**: Activities people already do, now with earning potential  
✅ **Dual Payment Model**: Both peer-to-peer and BittieTasks platform funding
✅ **Photo/Video Verification**: Easy automatic approval process
✅ **Community Building**: Mix of solo and shared activities
✅ **Reasonable Earnings**: $10-$25 range encourages participation

### Next Steps

To activate these curated tasks on your platform:

1. **Fix the API schema mismatch** in `/app/api/tasks/route.ts`
2. **Add tasks through Supabase dashboard** directly
3. **Test the payment flow** with these curated tasks
4. **Monitor user engagement** with daily task categories

These 8 tasks will provide a solid foundation for testing your peer-to-peer payment system while keeping the platform focused on inclusive daily activities that adults can realistically complete for supplemental income.
