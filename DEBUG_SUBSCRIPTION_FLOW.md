# SUBSCRIPTION FLOW DEBUG ANALYSIS

## Issue: Users visit /subscribe but get redirected to dashboard after 2 seconds

## Flow Analysis:

### 1. Route Structure:
- `/subscribe` - standalone page (NOT under dashboard routing)
- `/dashboard` - uses UnifiedAppRouter

### 2. Potential Issues:
1. **AuthProvider state changes** - auth loading to authenticated might trigger redirect
2. **Navigation interference** - something is programmatically navigating to /dashboard
3. **Component lifecycle** - useEffect causing unwanted navigation

### 3. Next Steps:
- Add debug logging to subscription page
- Check if AuthProvider state changes are triggering navigation
- Verify no global redirects for authenticated users to subscription pages

## Test Commands:
```bash
# Test unauthenticated access
curl -I http://localhost:5000/subscribe

# Test with browser to see exact flow
# Check browser console for navigation logs
```
