# CRITICAL: Vercel Project Routing Issue

## Problem Identified
- Your production URL shows: bittie-tasks-cchnmzer2-bittie-tasks.vercel.app
- But NONE of your 3 Vercel projects have this deployment URL
- This indicates a project routing or connection issue

## Possible Causes
1. **Old/Cached Deployment**: The URL might be from an old deployment that's still cached
2. **Team vs Personal Account**: Project might be under different team/account
3. **Hidden/Archived Project**: Project might be hidden or archived
4. **GitHub Connection Issue**: Repository connected to wrong project

## Immediate Actions to Take

### Step 1: Check All Vercel Accounts
- Check if you have multiple Vercel accounts (personal + team)
- Check if BittieTasks project is under different team

### Step 2: Find Active GitHub Connection
In each of your 3 BittieTasks projects:
1. Go to Settings → Git
2. Check which GitHub repository is connected
3. Find the one connected to your current repository

### Step 3: Alternative - Create New Deployment
If you can't find the active project:
1. Pick one of your 3 BittieTasks projects
2. Disconnect current GitHub connection (if any)
3. Connect it to your current repository
4. Add all environment variables to this project
5. Update domain settings

### Step 4: Domain Check
Check which project has www.bittietasks.com domain:
1. Go to each project → Settings → Domains
2. Look for bittietasks.com or www.bittietasks.com
3. This should be your active project

## Environment Variables Needed (for active project)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_URL (same as public URL)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
SENDGRID_API_KEY
```

## Next Steps
1. Find the project with your domain
2. Add missing environment variables
3. Redeploy
4. Clean up unused projects
