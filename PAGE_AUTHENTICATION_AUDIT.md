# Page Authentication Status Audit

## Currently Protected Pages (Require Authentication):
- ✅ `/create-task` - Authentication guard implemented
- ✅ `/create-barter` - Authentication guard implemented

## Pages That Should Be Protected But May Need Guards:
- ⚠️ `/dashboard` - Currently has mock user data, needs auth guard
- ⚠️ `/earnings` - User-specific data, should require authentication  
- ⚠️ `/task/[id]/verification` - Task verification requires authentication
- ⚠️ `/admin/approvals` - Admin functionality, needs authentication + admin check
- ⚠️ `/platform/create` - Platform task creation, needs authentication

## Public Pages (No Authentication Required):
- ✅ `/` (Home page) - Public landing page
- ✅ `/auth` - Authentication pages
- ✅ `/welcome` - Welcome flow
- ✅ `/community` - Public task browsing
- ✅ `/solo` - Public task browsing
- ✅ `/corporate` - Public task browsing  
- ✅ `/barter` - Public task browsing
- ✅ `/policies` - Public policies page
- ✅ `/sponsors` - Public sponsors page
- ✅ `/subscribe` - Public subscription page
- ✅ `/task/[id]` - Public task viewing (likely)

## Mixed Access Pages:
- ⚠️ `/platform` - Should show different content for authenticated vs public users

## Issues Found:
1. **Dashboard has mock user data instead of real authentication**
2. **Several user-specific pages lack authentication guards**
3. **Admin pages need both authentication and role checks**
