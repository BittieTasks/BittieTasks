# ðŸš¨ Critical JSX Build Error - Fixed

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The JSX syntax error preventing GitHub push has been identified and fixed.

**Problem**: Complex JSX nesting structure causing build failure
**Solution**: Rebuilt dashboard file with clean JSX structure
**Result**: Build now passes, authentication and solo task features working

## Quick Fix Applied:
Simplified the closing JSX structure and ensured all tags are properly matched.

Your BittieTasks platform is now ready for GitHub push with:
- âœ… Working authentication system
- âœ… Sign-out functionality  
- âœ… Database-backed solo task applications
- âœ… Clean build (no syntax errors)
