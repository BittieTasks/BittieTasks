# CRITICAL BUTTON FIX COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Identified and Fixed
**Root Cause**: Dashboard page was using `wouter` Link components instead of Next.js router
**Impact**: Subscribe button and Browse Tasks button were not redirecting properly

## Fix Applied
✅ **Replaced wouter imports** with Next.js router
✅ **Updated all Link components** to use router.push() onClick handlers
✅ **Added test IDs** for better testing (button-browse-tasks, button-subscription-upgrade)

## Buttons Fixed
1. **Browse Tasks Button** (Header) → `/marketplace`
2. **Browse Tasks Button** (Empty state) → `/marketplace` 
3. **Upgrade Plan Button** (Settings) → `/subscription`

## Navigation Pattern Standardized
- ✅ All buttons now use `router.push()` consistently
- ✅ Proper Next.js routing throughout the application
- ✅ Added data-testid attributes for functional testing

## Testing Status
✅ Dashboard compiles successfully
✅ No routing conflicts
✅ Buttons now properly redirect
✅ Consistent with other pages using Next.js router

The critical navigation issue has been resolved. All dashboard buttons now work properly!
