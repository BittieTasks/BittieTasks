# Simple Authentication Fix Plan

## What's Happening
Your task marketplace app is built and working, but users can't sign up or sign in. This is likely a simple configuration issue.

## Most Common Cause
Supabase requires email confirmation for new users, but the email provider isn't set up properly.

## Quick Fix Approach
1. Disable email confirmation temporarily 
2. Test authentication works
3. Set up email later if needed

## Step-by-Step Solution
I'll modify the authentication to work without email confirmation first, then we can add that back later once everything works.

This way you can:
- Test your task marketplace immediately  
- See users sign up and create tasks
- Add email verification later as polish
