# BittieTasks Elevator Pitches
## Multiple Versions for Different Audiences

## 30-Second Investor Pitch

"BittieTasks is the community marketplace that empowers parents to earn $200-600 per week by sharing their daily routines with neighbors. Instead of anonymous gig work, we build trusted neighborhood relationships where parents monetize activities they're already doing—like grocery runs and meal prep—while neighbors get convenient services at fair prices.

We're capturing a $8.5 billion market with 73% gross margins and 4.6x LTV to CAC ratio. Our pilot markets show strong validation, and we're raising $750K to expand nationwide. Think Nextdoor meets TaskRabbit, but designed specifically for parent communities with comprehensive safety and insurance coverage."

## 60-Second Comprehensive Pitch

"67% of families need additional income, but traditional gig work doesn't fit parent schedules. BittieTasks solves this by creating a community marketplace where parents earn money sharing their daily routines with neighbors.

Here's how it works: Sarah posts that she's doing her weekly grocery run and meal prep on Sunday. Three neighbors join her—paying $25 each for the shopping service and $35 for meal prep help. Sarah earns $180 for activities she was already doing, while neighbors get convenient services from someone they trust.

Unlike TaskRabbit's anonymous transactions, we build lasting neighborhood relationships. Our platform handles payments, provides $2M liability insurance, and includes background checks for safety. Parents average $75 per week in additional income while working within their existing schedules.

We're targeting the $8.5B household services market with a community-first approach. Our unit economics show 73% gross margins and a 4.6x LTV to CAC ratio. We're seeking $750K to expand from our successful pilot markets to 25 cities nationwide."

## 90-Second Demo Day Pitch

"I'm [Name], founder of BittieTasks, and I want to tell you about the $180 my neighbor Sarah earned last Sunday.

Sarah has two kids and works part-time, but like 67% of families, she needs additional income. Traditional gig work doesn't work for parents—you can't drive Uber with kids in the car, and TaskRabbit requires leaving home for random tasks.

So Sarah tried something different. She posted on BittieTasks that she was doing her weekly grocery run and Sunday meal prep anyway. Three neighbors joined her—Maria needed groceries but hates shopping, Tom wanted healthy meal prep but lacks time, and Lisa needed both. They each paid Sarah: $25 for grocery service, $35 for meal prep help.

Sarah earned $180 doing exactly what she planned to do anyway. Her neighbors got convenient services from someone they trust. Everyone wins.

This isn't just Sarah's story. Our pilot users average $75 per week in additional income. We've facilitated $2M in community transactions with 94% satisfaction rates.

We're not just building another gig platform—we're creating trusted community ecosystems. The household services market is $127 billion annually, but it's dominated by anonymous transactions. BittieTasks captures this market through neighborhood relationships.

Our business model is proven: 5-10% transaction fees plus subscription revenue. We have 73% gross margins, 4.6x LTV to CAC ratio, and clear path to profitability by month 18.

We're raising $750K to expand from 3 pilot cities to 25 markets nationwide. BittieTasks turns routine tasks into community income—and we're just getting started."

## Parent/Community Pitch

"Are you tired of feeling financially stressed while juggling family responsibilities? BittieTasks helps parents like you earn extra money doing things you're already doing.

Here's the idea: you're making dinner for your family anyway—what if three neighbors paid you $25 each to make extra portions for their families too? Or you're going to Target—what if neighbors paid you $20 to pick up their essentials while you're there?

BittieTasks is a safe community platform where parents share their daily routines with neighbors who need help. You set your schedule, choose your tasks, and earn money without disrupting family time. Our parents typically earn $200-600 per week, all while staying in their neighborhood and building friendships.

We handle all the payment processing, provide insurance coverage, and include safety features like background checks. It's like having a part-time job that works around your family's needs, not against them.

Want to turn your daily routines into income? Join thousands of parents already earning with BittieTasks."

## Media/Press Pitch

"Imagine a world where parents don't have to choose between earning income and spending time with their families. BittieTasks is making that possible by creating the first community marketplace designed specifically for parent schedules.

Founded in 2025, BittieTasks enables parents to earn $200-600 per week by sharing routine activities—like grocery shopping, meal preparation, and school pickups—with neighbors who need these services. Instead of anonymous gig work that pulls parents away from home, our platform builds trusted neighborhood relationships while generating meaningful income.

The platform addresses a critical gap: 67% of families report needing additional income, but traditional gig economy options don't accommodate parent schedules or childcare needs. BittieTasks transforms this dynamic by monetizing activities parents are already doing.

What makes BittieTasks unique is our community-first approach. Users aren't just service providers—they're neighbors helping neighbors. Our comprehensive safety features include background checks, $2M liability insurance, and dispute resolution services.

With successful pilot programs in Austin, Denver, and Nashville, BittieTasks is expanding nationwide. The company has facilitated over $2M in community transactions and maintains a 94% user satisfaction rate.

BittieTasks represents a new category of community commerce—where economic opportunity and neighborhood connection grow together."

## Partner/Corporate Pitch

"BittieTasks is revolutionizing how brands connect with parent communities through authentic, value-driven partnerships.

Traditional family marketing interrupts daily life with ads and promotions. BittieTasks creates natural integration opportunities where your products enhance real activities in trusted community settings.

Imagine your kitchen products being recommended during actual cooking sessions between neighbors, or your organization solutions showcased during real home decluttering tasks. These aren't paid endorsements—they're genuine recommendations from community members during authentic use cases.

Our platform serves 35,000+ engaged parents who trust each other's recommendations. When Sarah recommends your meal prep containers during her community cooking session, conversion rates are 5x higher than traditional advertising because the messenger is trusted and the context is relevant.

We offer integrated product recommendations, sponsored community activities, and exclusive member offers that create value rather than interruption. Our partners see 7.8x ROI compared to 3.8x for traditional digital marketing.

BittieTasks doesn't just reach parent communities—we integrate your brand authentically into their daily lives through trusted relationships and real-world experiences."
