# SendGrid Production Setup Guide

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ **API Key**: Configured and working
- ‚úÖ **Email Service**: Code implemented and ready
- üü° **Domain Verification**: **NEEDS ACTION** - This is blocking production emails
- üü° **Sender Authentication**: Required for production delivery

## üö® The Issue
SendGrid is configured but **domain verification** is required for production email delivery. Without this, emails may be rejected or marked as spam.

## üìã Required Actions

### Step 1: Access SendGrid Dashboard
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com)
2. Login with your SendGrid account credentials

### Step 2: Domain Verification (Critical)
1. Navigate to **Settings > Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Domain**
3. Enter your domain: `bittietasks.com`
4. Follow the DNS verification process:
   - SendGrid will provide DNS records (CNAME entries)
   - Add these DNS records to your domain's DNS settings
   - Wait for propagation (usually 24-48 hours)

### Step 3: Single Sender Verification (Quick Alternative)
If domain verification takes too long, you can verify individual email addresses:

1. Go to **Settings > Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
3. Add these email addresses:
   - `support@bittietasks.com` (for verification emails)
   - `noreply@bittietasks.com` (for system notifications)
4. Check the inbox for each email and click verification links

### Step 4: Test Email Delivery
Once verification is complete, test with our endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://bittietasks.com/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "your-email@example.com",
    "subject": "Production Test"
  }'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SendGrid Best Practices

### Email Types We Send
1. **Account Verification**: New user email confirmation
2. **Welcome Emails**: Post-verification welcome message  
3. **Password Reset**: Security-related password changes
4. **Upgrade Confirmations**: Subscription and plan changes
5. **Task Notifications**: Activity updates and earnings

### Sender Addresses Used
- `support@bittietasks.com` - Customer support and verification
- `noreply@bittietasks.com` - System notifications and automated emails

### Rate Limits & Monitoring
- Current Plan: Essentials (40,000 emails/month)
- Rate Limit: 6,000 emails/hour
- Daily Limit: ~1,300 emails/day
- Monitoring: Delivery rates, bounces, and spam reports

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Email Service Functions
```typescript
// Available email functions in server/services/emailService.ts
sendVerificationEmail(userEmail, userName, token)    // Account verification
sendWelcomeEmail(userEmail, userName)               // Post-verification welcome
sendPasswordResetEmail(userEmail, resetToken)      // Password reset
sendUpgradeConfirmationEmail(userEmail, planName)  // Subscription upgrades
```

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when SendGrid is unavailable
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Retry logic for temporary failures

## ‚úÖ Post-Verification Checklist

Once domain verification is complete:

1. **Test All Email Types**:
   - [ ] Account verification emails
   - [ ] Welcome emails  
   - [ ] Password reset emails
   - [ ] Upgrade confirmation emails

2. **Monitor Delivery Rates**:
   - [ ] Check SendGrid analytics dashboard
   - [ ] Monitor bounce rates (<2% target)
   - [ ] Track spam complaint rates (<0.1% target)

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - [ ] Mark domain verification as complete
   - [ ] Update integration status to "Production Ready"

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **403 Forbidden**: Domain not verified (most common)
2. **401 Unauthorized**: API key issue (unlikely since initialization works)
3. **High Bounce Rate**: Invalid email addresses
4. **Spam Issues**: Missing SPF/DKIM records

### Support Resources
- [SendGrid Support](https://support.sendgrid.com)
- [Domain Verification Guide](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication)
- [API Documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference)

## üí∞ Cost Implications
- **Current**: $19.95/month for 40,000 emails
- **Usage**: ~500-1,000 emails/day for active platform
- **Scaling**: May need to upgrade plan at 25,000+ users

**Next Action**: Complete domain verification for `bittietasks.com` in SendGrid dashboard to enable production email delivery.
