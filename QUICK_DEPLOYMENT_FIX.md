# Quick Production Fix - Two Options

## OPTION 1: Fix Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Clear git locks (run these exact commands)
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD.lock .git/refs/remotes/origin/main.lock .git/refs/heads/main.lock

# Quick commit and push
git add . && git commit -m "Fix production: ESLint and environment vars" && git push origin main
```

## OPTION 2: Manual Vercel Deploy (Immediate)
If git is still broken:
1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your BittieTasks project
3. Go to Deployments tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## Why Both Work:
- **Your Vercel environment variables are already correct** (SendGrid + Supabase keys added)
- **Your code fixes are complete** (ESLint working, build passing)
- **Just need to trigger deployment** (either via git push or manual redeploy)

## Expected Result:
✅ Production signup at https://www.bittietasks.com/auth will work
✅ Users can create accounts and receive verification emails
✅ No more "Internal server error" on signup

**Either option will solve the production signup issue immediately.**
