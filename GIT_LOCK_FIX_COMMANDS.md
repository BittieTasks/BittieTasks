# Fix GitHub Checks and Push Issues

## Issue Found: ESLint Configuration Missing

The build passes but GitHub checks fail because linting isn't configured.

## Quick Fix Commands:

```bash
# Remove any git locks
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/heads/main.lock

# Add the ESLint config and commit
git add .eslintrc.json
git commit -m "Add ESLint configuration to fix GitHub checks"

# Push to trigger successful deployment  
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Bypass Vercel for Now

**Since your Vercel environment variables are already updated correctly**, you can manually trigger a Vercel deployment:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → BittieTasks → Deployments
2. **Click "Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. **This will deploy with your updated environment variables**

## Test After Deployment:
The production signup should work immediately after the Vercel redeploy, even if GitHub is still having issues.

**Priority: Get Vercel working first, then fix GitHub checks.**
