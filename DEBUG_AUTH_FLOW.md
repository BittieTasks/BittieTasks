# Authentication Flow Debug Report

## Environment Status: ✅ WORKING
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Present (https://ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj.supabase.co)  
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Present (JWT token)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Present
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Present

## Identified Issues:

### 1. Missing Required Secrets for Server Functions
**Problem:** API routes need service role key for database operations
**Status:** ✅ Keys are present in environment

### 2. Client-Server Auth Token Mismatch  
**Problem:** Client uses anon key, server needs service role key
**Solution:** Update server client to use proper auth flow

### 3. Profile Creation Flow
**Problem:** Trying to create profile before user is fully authenticated
**Solution:** Simplify and fix the profile creation timing

## Next Steps:
1. Fix server client authentication method
2. Test sign in/sign up flow end-to-end
3. Verify profile creation works properly
4. Test protected route access
