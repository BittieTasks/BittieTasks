# Testing Your Supabase SMTP Configuration

## Your Setup Status

✅ Password validation updated to match Supabase requirements

## How to Test SMTP Configuration

### Method 1: Test in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings
3. Look for "Send test email" button
4. Enter a real email address and click send
5. Check if email arrives

### Method 2: Test Signup Flow in Your App
1. Go to your BittieTasks app (click the webview)
2. Navigate to the signup/login page
3. Try signing up with:
   - A real email address you control
   - Strong password: `MySecurePass123!`
4. Submit the form and check for success message
5. Check your email inbox for verification email

### Method 3: Check Supabase Logs
1. In Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Logs → Auth
3. Look for recent signup attempts and email sending logs
4. Check for any SMTP errors

## Expected Results

**If SMTP is configured correctly:**
- ✅ Supabase test email arrives in inbox
- ✅ Signup shows "Check your email" message
- ✅ Verification email arrives from Supabase
- ✅ Email has professional BittieTasks branding

**If SMTP needs adjustment:**
- ❌ Test email fails to send
- ❌ Signup works but no email received
- ❌ Error messages in Supabase logs
- ❌ SMTP connection errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**No emails received:**
- Double-check API key in SMTP settings
- Verify sender email is authenticated in SendGrid
- Check spam/junk folder

**SMTP connection errors:**
- Confirm port 587 (not 465 or 25)
- Username should be exactly `apikey`
- Password should be your SendGrid API key

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify SendGrid account is active
- Check API key permissions in SendGrid
