# Spinning Circle Authentication Status

## Current Status
- **WebSocket Error**: Not related to authentication - this is for real-time features only
- **Authentication Fix**: Manual system implemented to bypass Supabase Storage issues
- **Expected Behavior**: No more spinning circles during login attempts

## Console Output Analysis
From the logs, I can see:
- AuthProvider is initializing properly
- Manual auth system is loading 
- HomePage is rendering correctly
- No authentication errors in the console

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Try logging in with existing credentials
2. The spinning circle should be gone
3. Authentication should complete quickly
4. Manual session management will handle persistence

## WebSocket Issue (Separate)
The WebSocket error (`wss://www.bittietasks.com/ws`) is unrelated to authentication:
- This affects real-time features only
- Does not impact login/signup functionality
- Can be addressed separately if needed
