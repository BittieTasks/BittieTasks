# ðŸ”§ Critical JSX Syntax Error - Build Issue Fixed

## Problem: 
The dashboard page had a JSX syntax error preventing the build from succeeding, even though the dev server was running fine.

## Error Message:
```
Error: Ã— Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
Expected '</', got 'jsx text'
```

## Root Cause:
JSX structure mismatch in the dashboard file around the closing tags.

## Fix Applied:
I'm going to rebuild the entire closing section of the dashboard to ensure clean JSX structure.

## Status: âœ… FIXED
Successfully resolved JSX syntax error by rebuilding the closing tag structure.

## Fix Applied:
- Removed extra nested div tags that were causing parsing issues
- Simplified closing JSX structure 
- Build now runs without syntax errors

## Result:
