# Manual Git Push Steps

## Run These Commands in Terminal:

```bash
# Add all new files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Complete SendGrid integration for reliable email verification"

# Push to GitHub main branch
git push origin main
```

## New Files Being Pushed:
- `lib/sendgrid.ts` - SendGrid email service integration
- `app/api/auth/test-sendgrid/route.ts` - SendGrid test endpoint
- `app/api/auth/test-complete-flow/route.ts` - Complete auth flow test
- Various setup and troubleshooting documentation

## After Git Push:
- Vercel will automatically detect changes and deploy
- SendGrid integration will be live in production
- Friends can test authentication (should work once SMTP propagates)

## Current Status:
- SendGrid ✅ Working (test emails sent successfully)
- Supabase SMTP ✅ Configured (waiting for propagation)
- Code ✅ Ready to deploy
- Vercel ❌ Failed to load (will be fixed with git push)
