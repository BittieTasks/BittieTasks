# Test Your Subscription Flow

## READY TO TEST!

Your test environment variables are updated. Now let's verify the subscription flow works:

### **STEP 1: Test the Subscription Button**

1. **Go to**: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe
2. **Sign in** (make sure you're authenticated)  
3. **Open browser dev tools** (F12) â†’ Console tab
4. **Click either "Pro Plan" or "Premium Plan" button**

### **EXPECTED RESULT:**
- Should redirect to Stripe test checkout page
- URL will contain `checkout.stripe.com`
- No error in browser console

### **STEP 2: Complete Test Purchase**

**Use Test Card Information:**
- **Card Number**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Expiry**: Any future date (like 12/25)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (like 123)
- **Email**: Your real email (you'll get test receipts)

### **EXPECTED RESULT:**
- Checkout should complete successfully
- Should redirect back to BittieTasks
- You should see success confirmation

### **STEP 3: Verify in Stripe Dashboard**

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers
2. **Check**: You should see your test customer created
3. **Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions  
4. **Check**: You should see active test subscription

## **IF SOMETHING FAILS:**

- Copy the exact error message from browser console
- Share it with me for immediate debugging
- Common issues: wrong price IDs or API key format

## **SUCCESS MEANS:**

Your subscription system is technically perfect! Once you complete tax setup and switch back to live keys, real payments will work immediately.

**Test it now and let me know what happens!**
