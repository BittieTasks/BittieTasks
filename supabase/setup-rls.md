3. **Verify Policies Applied**

## What These Policies Do

### Security Features:

- **Task Categories**: Public read access, admin-only management
- **Tasks**: Public read access, users can manage their own tasks

- **Messages**: Users see only messages they sent/received
- **Achievements**: Users see only their achievements
- **Admin Access**: Special privileges for admin@bittietasks.com

### Key Benefits:
- âœ… **Data Isolation**: Users can't access other users' private data
- âœ… **Admin Controls**: Dedicated admin access for platform management
- âœ… **Public Content**: Task categories and tasks visible to all users

## Testing RLS

After applying policies, test with:
```bash
# Should work - public data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" http://localhost:5000/api/categories

# Should work - user's own data  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" http://localhost:5000/api/auth/user

# Should fail - other user's data (in Supabase directly)
```
