# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Since Environment Variables Are Already Set:

### 1. Check Deployment Status:
- Go to **"Deployments"** tab in your Vercel project
- Look at the latest deployment status
- Check for any build errors or failures

### 2. Force New Deployment:
**Option A: Redeploy**
- Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment in Vercel

**Option B: Push Small Change**
- We can push a small update to trigger auto-deployment

### 3. Common Issues to Check:
- Build errors in deployment logs
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variable formatting

### 4. What to Look For:
- âœ… Build succeeded
- âœ… Deployment completed  
- âœ… Live URL accessible
- âœ… No console errors

## Current Status:
- âœ… Code pushed to GitHub
- âœ… Vercel project connected
- âœ… Environment variables set
- ðŸ”„ Waiting for successful deployment

Your revenue platform should be live once deployment completes successfully!
