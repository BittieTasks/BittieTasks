# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Let's Check Your Deployment:

### 1. Check Deployment Status
In your Vercel dashboard:
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Look for the status: Building, Ready, or Failed
- If it says "Failed" - click on it to see error logs

### 2. Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: Build Failed**
- Check if all 4 environment variables were added correctly
- Variable names must be EXACT (case-sensitive)
- No quotes around values

**Issue: Site Loads but Features Don't Work**
- Environment variables might be missing or incorrect
- Need to redeploy after adding variables

**Issue: "Nothing Happened"**
- Your site might be live but at a different URL
- Check the "Domains" section for your actual URL

### 3. Your Environment Variables Should Be:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_... (from Replit Secrets)
SENDGRID_API_KEY = SG.... (from Replit Secrets)
```

### 4. Force Redeploy:
After fixing environment variables:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click the 3 dots on latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"

### 5. Check Your Live URL:
Your site should be at something like:
`https://bittietasks-[random].vercel.app`

## Next Steps:
1. Tell me what you see in your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the Deployments tab for status
3. Share any error messages you see
