# Unused Index Cleanup Instructions

## Important Notes:

**These unused indexes don't hurt your platform's performance at all.** They're just using some storage space and generating informational warnings.

## Options:

### Option 1: Ignore the Warnings (Recommended)
- Your BittieTasks platform is fully optimized and working perfectly
- Unused indexes don't impact user experience or performance
