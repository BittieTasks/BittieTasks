# Database Function Security Fix

## Security Warnings Detected
Supabase has flagged two database functions with mutable search paths:
- `public.migrate_user_data`
- `public.handle_new_user`

## Security Risk
Functions with mutable search paths can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through search_path manipulation.

## Fix Required

### Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj
2. Navigate to: **SQL Editor**
3. Run this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix function search path security warnings
-- These functions need to have their search_path explicitly set for security

-- Fix migrate_user_data function
ALTER FUNCTION public.migrate_user_data() SET search_path = '';

-- Fix handle_new_user function  
ALTER FUNCTION public.handle_new_user() SET search_path = '';
```

## What This Does
- Sets explicit empty search_path for both functions
- Prevents potential SQL injection via search_path manipulation
- Ensures functions execute with predictable schema resolution
- Follows PostgreSQL security best practices

## Verification
After running the fix, the security warnings should disappear from your Supabase Security Advisor.

## Impact
- Improves database security posture
- Follows industry best practices
- Eliminates security warnings
- No functional changes to your application
