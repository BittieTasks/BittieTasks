# Task Count Update Summary

## Current Status:
- **Tasks on website**: 0 (empty database)
- **Database issue**: Schema mismatch between code and database

## Database Schema Issues Found:
1. ❌ `earning_potential` column doesn't exist
2. ❌ `duration` column doesn't exist  
3. ❌ `current_participants` column doesn't exist
4. ❌ `approval_status` column doesn't exist
5. ❌ `host_id` column doesn't exist

## Fix Required:
The database schema in Supabase doesn't match the Drizzle schema definition in `shared/schema.ts`. Need to push schema changes to database.
