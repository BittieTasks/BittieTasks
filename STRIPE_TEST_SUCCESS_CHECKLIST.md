# Stripe Test Mode Success Checklist

## After Vercel Redeploy Completes:

### 1. Test Environment Variables
Wait for redeploy to finish, then check:
```
https://www.bittietasks.com/api/env-debug
```
Should show:
- `secret_key.is_secret_key: true`
- `secret_key.is_test_key: true`
- `diagnosis.keys_are_valid: true`

### 2. Test Subscription Flow
1. Go to: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe
2. Sign in (ensure authenticated)
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Click "Pro Plan" button

### Expected Success:
- Console shows: `=== STRIPE KEY DEBUG ===` with `Starts with sk_: true`
- Redirects to: `checkout.stripe.com` (Stripe test checkout)
- Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future date, any CVC
- Should complete successfully

### 3. Verify in Stripe Dashboard
After test purchase:
- Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions

- Customer created in: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers

### Success Indicators:
