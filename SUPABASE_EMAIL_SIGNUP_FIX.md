# Supabase Email Signup Fix Required

## Issue: 
Disabling email confirmations also disabled email signups entirely.
Error: "Email signups are disabled"

## Fix Needed in Supabase Dashboard:

### 1. Re-enable Email Provider
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj
- Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Email Auth**
- **Turn ON**: "Enable email provider" (this allows signups)
- **Keep OFF**: "Enable email confirmations" (this disables verification emails)

### 2. Alternative: Use Custom Auth Provider
If the above doesn't work, configure:
- **Enable email provider**: ON
- **Enable email confirmations**: OFF  
- **Confirm email change**: OFF
- **Secure email change**: OFF

## Expected Result:
- Users can sign up with email/password ✅
- No Supabase verification emails sent ✅  
- Your custom SendGrid verification system handles email verification ✅
- Authentication works properly ✅

## The Settings Should Look Like:
```
✅ Enable email provider: ON
❌ Enable email confirmations: OFF
❌ Confirm email change: OFF  
❌ Secure email change: OFF
```

This allows signups while letting your SendGrid system handle verification!
