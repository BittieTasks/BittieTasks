# GitHub Error Diagnosis and Resolution

## Current Situation:
- Local git says "everything up to date"
- GitHub showing errors/failures
- Need to identify the disconnect between local and remote

## Possible Causes:
1. **GitHub Actions/Checks failing** - Build or lint errors on GitHub's side
2. **Branch sync issues** - Local thinks it's synced but remote has different state  
3. **Workflow configuration problems** - GitHub Actions not configured properly
4. **Build environment differences** - Different Node.js versions or dependencies

## Investigation Steps:
1. Check remote repository status
2. Verify GitHub Actions workflow status
3. Compare local vs remote commit history
4. Test build in GitHub environment vs local

## Resolution Strategy:
- Force sync local with remote if needed
- Fix GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Ensure build passes in GitHub's environment
- Deploy through working path (Vercel direct if needed)

## Priority:
Get production signup working - GitHub CI can be fixed after deployment succeeds.
