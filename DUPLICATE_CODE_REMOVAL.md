# Critical Duplicate Code Issues Found - August 17, 2025

## MAJOR PROBLEM: Multiple Auth Systems Running Simultaneously

### **4 Different Auth State Listeners Active:**
1. `components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` - Main auth system (KEEP)
2. `hooks/useSimpleAuth.tsx` - Duplicate listener with üîç logs (REMOVE)
3. `hooks/useSupabaseAuth.tsx` - Duplicate listener with üîê logs (REMOVE) 
4. `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Creates own Supabase client + listener (REMOVE)

### **2 Duplicate Supabase Client Files:**
1. `lib/supabase.ts` - Main client (KEEP)
2. `lib/lib/supabase.ts` - Duplicate with wrong env vars (REMOVE)

## ROOT CAUSE OF AUTHENTICATION REDIRECT LOOP
Multiple `onAuthStateChange` listeners are fighting over session state and redirects.
Each system thinks it needs to handle the authentication flow independently.

## SOLUTION NEEDED
Remove ALL duplicate auth hooks and keep only the main AuthProvider system.
This will eliminate the conflicting auth state management.

**Status: Ready to remove duplicates without breaking functionality**
