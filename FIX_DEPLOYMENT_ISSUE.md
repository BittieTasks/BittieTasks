# ðŸ”§ Fix Vercel Deployment Issue

## Let's Check What Happened:

### 1. Check if Code is on GitHub
- Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bittietasks`
- Do you see all your project files there?
- Check the latest commit date

### 2. Common Issues:

**Issue A: Code Not Pushed to GitHub**
```bash
# Run these in Replit Shell:
git add .
git commit -m "Complete BittieTasks platform ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Issue B: Vercel Can't Access Repository**
- In Vercel: Settings â†’ Git Repository
- Make sure it's connected to the right repo
- Try reimporting the project

**Issue C: Build Configuration Issue**
- Check if Vercel detected it as Next.js project
- Framework should show "Next.js"
- Build command should be "next build"

### 3. Force Deployment:
In Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "Create Deployment"
- Select your main branch
- Force deploy

### 4. Check Build Logs:
If deployment fails:
- Click on the failed deployment
- Read the build logs for specific errors
- Usually shows missing environment variables or build errors

## Quick Test:
Can you see your project files when you visit:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bittietasks`

If no files are there, we need to push the code properly.
