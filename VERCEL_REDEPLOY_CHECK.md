# Vercel Environment Variable Update Issue

## LIKELY PROBLEM: Deployment Not Updated

Even if you updated environment variables in Vercel, the deployment might not have automatically redeployed with the new variables.

## FORCE REDEPLOY:

### Option 1: Trigger Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your BittieTasks project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### Option 2: Trigger Redeploy from GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Make any small change (add a space in README)
3. Commit and push
4. This will trigger automatic redeploy

### Option 3: Manual Environment Variable Refresh
1. In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Edit each variable (even if correct)
3. Save each one
4. This forces a redeploy

## THEN TEST:

After redeployment completes (1-2 minutes):
1. Go to: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe
2. Try subscription button
3. Check browser console for new debug messages

## EXPECTED RESULT:

The debug logs should now show:
- "Starts with sk_: true"
- "Is test key: true" 
- Proper key format

If still getting publishable key error, the environment variables aren't being read correctly by the deployment.
