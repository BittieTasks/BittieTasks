# Corporate-Sponsored Task Revenue Model

## Business Model: BittieTasks as Corporate Partner Platform

### Core Concept:
Instead of neighbors paying each other, **corporations sponsor tasks** that users complete for money. BittieTasks becomes a marketing platform where companies pay for user engagement and brand exposure.

## Revenue Structure Analysis

### Traditional Model (Neighbor-to-Neighbor):
```
$100 task → User pays neighbor $100 → BittieTasks gets $7 fee
Revenue: $7 per transaction
Volume needed: 1,000+ transactions/month for sustainability
```

### Corporate-Sponsored Model:
```
Corporate Partner pays BittieTasks $200 for task sponsorship
User receives $100 for completing task
BittieTasks keeps $100 (50% margin)
Revenue: $100 per transaction (14x higher!)
Volume needed: 70+ transactions/month for sustainability
```
