# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Authentication Flow Issue

## Problem Report
User reports: "authentication flow isn't working, I am not even able to sign in now as an already authenticated user"

## Quick Diagnosis
- Auth page loads (200 response)
- Supabase client configuration appears intact
- AuthProvider context available
- Sign in/up functions exist

## Potential Issues to Check:
1. **Environment Variables**: Supabase URL/ANON_KEY might be swapped again
2. **Auth State Management**: User session not persisting
3. **Navigation**: Redirect after auth might be broken
4. **API Routes**: Profile creation might be failing

## Immediate Fix Plan:
1. Verify Supabase environment variables
2. Check auth state in browser
3. Test sign in with existing user
4. Fix any blocking authentication issues

## Status: FIXING NOW
