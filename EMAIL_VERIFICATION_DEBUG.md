# Email Verification Debug Guide

## What I Just Fixed

1. **Enhanced URL Parameter Parsing** - Better handling of verification tokens
2. **Added Debug Logging** - Console logs will show what's happening during verification  
3. **Improved Authentication Flow** - Added PKCE flow type for better security
4. **Better Error Handling** - More specific error messages

## How to Test the Updated Verification

**Step 1: Try New Signup**
- Use a fresh email address (don't reuse previous ones)
- Create account with password: `MySecurePass123!`
- Look for "Check your email" message

**Step 2: Check Email Verification**
- Check your email for verification link
- Click the verification link
- **Important:** Open browser developer tools (F12) before clicking
- Go to Console tab to see debug logs

**Step 3: What to Look For**
In browser console, you should see logs like:
```
Current URL: https://yourdomain.com/verify-email?access_token=...
URL search: ?access_token=...&type=signup...
Parsed tokens: {access_token: true, refresh_token: true, type: "signup"}
Setting session with tokens...
User verified successfully: your-email@example.com
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

**If verification still fails:**

1. **Check Console Logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Check URL Format** - Verification link should have `access_token` and `type=signup`
3. **Check Supabase Settings** - Verify redirect URL matches exactly: `https://your-repl-url/verify-email?type=signup`

## Next Steps Based on Results
