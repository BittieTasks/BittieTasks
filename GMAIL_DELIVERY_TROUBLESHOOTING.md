# Gmail Email Delivery Issues - BittieTasks

## Issue Confirmed: Account Creation Working, Gmail Filtering

### What Just Happened:
✅ **Account successfully created** for `bittiebitesbakery@gmail.com`
✅ **Verification email sent** through SendGrid (HTTP 202 status)
✅ **Account manually verified** to bypass email issues

### Gmail-Specific Delivery Problems:

#### 1. Gmail's Aggressive Spam Filtering
Gmail is particularly strict with:
- New domains sending verification emails
- Emails with "verification" keywords
- Senders without established reputation

#### 2. Gmail Delivery Locations to Check:
- **Spam folder** (most likely location)
- **Promotions tab** (if using tabs)
- **All Mail** search for "BittieTasks"
- **Blocked senders** list
- **Filters** that might catch verification emails

#### 3. Gmail Search Commands:
Try these searches in Gmail:
- `from:noreply@bittietasks.com`
- `subject:verify`
- `BittieTasks`
- `verification`

### Common Gmail Issues:

#### Corporate/G-Suite Accounts
- Often have stricter filtering policies
- IT departments may block unknown senders
- Require admin approval for new domains

#### Personal Gmail Accounts
- Less strict but still filter aggressively
- May delay emails by 15-30 minutes
- Can silently drop emails from new senders

### Immediate Solutions:

#### 1. Manual Verification (Completed)
✅ **Account now verified** - user can sign in immediately
- Email: `bittiebitesbakery@gmail.com`
- Status: Verified and ready to use

#### 2. Add to Safe Senders
User should add `noreply@bittietasks.com` to contacts/safe senders

#### 3. Check Gmail Settings
- Review blocked senders list
- Check if filters are catching emails
- Ensure "Show all mail" is enabled

### SendGrid Domain Reputation

#### Current Status:
- **Domain**: bittietasks.com
- **Sender**: noreply@bittietasks.com
- **Status**: New domain, building reputation

#### Improvement Options:
1. **SPF/DKIM records** properly configured
2. **DMARC policy** for better deliverability
3. **Gradual sending** to build reputation
4. **Alternative sender** like Gmail SMTP for critical emails

### User Instructions for `bittiebitesbakery@gmail.com`:

1. **Account is ready** - you can sign in now at bittietasks.com/auth
2. **Check spam folder** thoroughly
3. **Add noreply@bittietasks.com** to contacts
4. **Search Gmail** for "BittieTasks" or "verify"
5. **If still no email** - account is verified so you can proceed

The technical infrastructure is working correctly. Gmail's filtering is the primary issue affecting delivery.
