# CRITICAL: Multiple Vercel Projects Issue

## Problem Identified
You have 3 different BittieTasks projects in Vercel:
- This creates confusion about which project is active
- Environment variables may be scattered across projects
- Deployments may be going to wrong project
- Domain pointing may be incorrect

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Identify Active Project
Check which project your domain (www.bittietasks.com) is actually pointing to:
1. In Vercel Dashboard, check each BittieTasks project
2. Look for the one with "bittie-tasks-cchnmzer2-bittie-tasks.vercel.app" 
   (this matches your current deployment URL from env-check)
3. This is your ACTIVE project

### Step 2: Consolidate Environment Variables
Add ALL required variables to the ACTIVE project:

**Required Variables for Active Project:**
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
- SUPABASE_URL (same as NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- SENDGRID_API_KEY

### Step 3: Clean Up Other Projects
For the 2 inactive BittieTasks projects:
1. Check if they have any important environment variables
2. Copy any missing variables to the active project
3. Consider deleting unused projects to avoid confusion

### Step 4: Verify Domain Connection
Ensure www.bittietasks.com points to the correct active project:
1. In active project → Settings → Domains
2. Verify bittietasks.com and www.bittietasks.com are listed
3. If not, add them and remove from other projects

## Current Status
✅ Identified: bittie-tasks-cchnmzer2-bittie-tasks.vercel.app as active deployment
❌ Issue: Environment variables may be in wrong project
❌ Issue: Multiple projects causing deployment confusion

## Next Steps
1. Find the active project (matches the deployment URL)
2. Add missing environment variables to THAT specific project
3. Redeploy from the correct project
4. Clean up unused projects
