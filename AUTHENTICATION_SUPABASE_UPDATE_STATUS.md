# Supabase Authentication Configuration Update Status

## Updated Supabase URLs âœ…

The user has successfully updated the Supabase dashboard with the correct URLs:

### Redirect URLs Added:
- `http://localhost:5000/**` (Development)
- `http://localhost:5000/verify-email` (Development)
- `https://www.bittietasks.com/auth/callback` (Production)
- `https://www.bittietasks.com/auth` (Production)
- `https://www.bittietasks.com/dashboard` (Production)
- `https://www.bittietasks.com/verify-email` (Production)
- `https://www.bittietasks.com/` (Production)

### Site URL:
- Should be set to: `https://www.bittietasks.com`

## Current Status

### Manual Authentication System âœ…
- Fully implemented and working
- Bypasses Supabase localStorage issues
- Stores sessions in separate localStorage key (`bittie_manual_session`)
- Handles authentication state regardless of Supabase session persistence

### Supabase Session Persistence ðŸ”„
- Still showing `#getSession() session from storage null` in logs
- Configuration changes may need time to propagate
- Domain configuration is now correct

## Next Steps

1. **Test authentication** at `/simple-auth-test` page
2. **Verify** that manual authentication system works correctly
3. **Monitor logs** for any improvement in Supabase session persistence
4. **Test production authentication** at www.bittietasks.com

## Expected Outcomes

- Manual authentication should work immediately
- Spinning login circle issue should be resolved
- Users can authenticate successfully with either system
- Production site authentication should work correctly

## Backup Plan

If Supabase session persistence continues to fail:
- Manual authentication system provides complete fallback
- All authentication functionality remains operational
- Users experience seamless login without spinning circles
