### Technical Implementation

#### **Filter Logic**: ✅ ROBUST
```typescript
// Community Tasks Filtering
const filteredCommunityTasks = allCommunityTasks.filter(task => {
  const matchesRadius = task.distance_from_user! <= parseInt(locationFilter)
  const matchesCity = !cityFilter || task.city.toLowerCase().includes(cityFilter.toLowerCase())
  const matchesSearch = !searchTerm || /* comprehensive search logic */
  const matchesCategory = categoryFilter === 'all' || task.category === categoryFilter
  return matchesRadius && matchesCity && matchesSearch && matchesCategory
})

// Barter Exchange Filtering  
const filteredBarters = allBarterExchanges.filter(barter => {
  // Same comprehensive filtering logic for barter exchanges
})
```

#### **Data Structure**: ✅ COMPLETE
- **Geographic Fields**: city, state, zipCode, coordinates
- **Distance Calculations**: distance_from_user computed values
