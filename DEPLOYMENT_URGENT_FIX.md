# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Deployment Using Wrong Commit

## Issue Identified
The Vercel deployment is using commit `f06eaf8` (the old broken version) instead of the latest fixed commit `c5a70a9`.

## Status Verification
âœ… **Local build working**: `npm run build` completes successfully with 16 pages generated
âœ… **JSX syntax fixed**: `app/platform/page.tsx` no longer has the syntax errors  
âœ… **All TypeScript errors resolved**: Build completes without compilation errors

## Current State
- **Local HEAD**: `c5a70a9` (FIXED VERSION)
- **Vercel deploying**: `f06eaf8` (BROKEN VERSION)

## Required Action
The deployment system needs to pull the latest commit. This typically happens automatically, but may require:

1. **Manual deployment trigger** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Force push** to ensure remote repository is updated
3. **Clear deployment cache** if Vercel is stuck on old commit

## Verification
To confirm the issue is resolved, the deployment log should show:
- Cloning the latest commit (c5a70a9 or newer)
- Successful Next.js build completion
- No JSX syntax errors in app/platform/page.tsx

The fixes are ready and working - just need the deployment to use the correct version.
