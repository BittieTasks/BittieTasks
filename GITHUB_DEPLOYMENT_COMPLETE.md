# Complete GitHub Deployment Guide

## Current Deployment Status
✅ **Local Build**: Working perfectly with Next.js 15.4.6
✅ **All Fixes Applied**: JSX syntax errors resolved, Vercel config updated
✅ **Test Deployment**: Temporary Vercel deployment successful (16 pages built)
❌ **Main Domain**: Needs GitHub push to trigger auto-deployment

## Required Manual Actions

Since git operations are restricted in this environment, you need to run these commands in your local terminal:

### Step 1: Clear Git Locks
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/refs/remotes/origin/main.lock
```

### Step 2: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit Deployment Fixes
```bash
git commit -m "Complete deployment configuration fixes

- Fixed vercel.json with direct environment variables
- Resolved JSX syntax errors in app/platform/page.tsx  
- Updated runtime configuration for @vercel/node
- All 16 pages build successfully in production
- Ready for GitHub auto-deployment to main domain"
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## What Happens After Push
1. **GitHub**: Receives the updated code with all fixes
2. **Vercel Webhook**: Automatically triggers new deployment
3. **Build Process**: Uses fixed configuration to build successfully  
4. **Main Domain**: BittieTasks.com gets the working version
5. **Result**: All 16 pages available with professional UI

## Files Being Deployed
- `vercel.json` - Fixed environment variables and runtime
- `app/platform/page.tsx` - Resolved JSX syntax errors
- `next.config.js` - Proper Next.js configuration

## Verification
After pushing, check:
