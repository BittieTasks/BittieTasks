# Email Verification System - SUCCESS! üéâ

## Issue Resolution Complete

**Problem**: Email verification not creating user profiles, preventing access to authenticated features.

**Root Cause**: Profile creation was failing due to incorrect column names in the database insertion.

**Solution**: Fixed profile creation to use the correct database schema from the `users` table.

## Current Status: WORKING

### ‚úÖ Verified Users
- **caitlin.landrigan@gmail.com**: 
  - Email verified: YES
  - Profile created: YES 
  - Full app access: READY
  - Subscription tier: Free
  - Monthly task limit: 5

### ‚è≥ Pending Verification
- **grant.labrosse@gmail.com**:
  - Email verified: NO
  - Needs to click email verification link
  - Profile will be created automatically once verified

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Profile Creation ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Fixed /api/user/current endpoint to create profiles for verified users
const newProfileData = {
  id: req.user.id,
  email: req.user.email,
  first_name: req.user.user_metadata?.first_name || null,
  last_name: req.user.user_metadata?.last_name || null,
  username: req.user.email?.split('@')[0] || 'user',
};
```

### 2. Database Schema Working ‚úÖ
