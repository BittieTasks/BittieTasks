# 🔐 Fix GitHub Authentication

## The Issue:
GitHub requires authentication to push code. You need a Personal Access Token.

## Quick Solution:

### Option 1: Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Replit BittieTasks"
4. Check "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with ghp_)

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (Faster)
In Replit Shell:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment
Download project as ZIP and upload directly to GitHub:
1. Replit menu → Download as ZIP
2. Go to your GitHub repo
3. Upload files → Drag and drop all files
4. Commit directly on GitHub

## After Authentication:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Your complete revenue platform will be on GitHub and Vercel will deploy automatically!
