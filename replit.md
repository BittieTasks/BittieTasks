# BittieTasks Mobile Application

## Overview

BittieTasks is a mobile-first React web application designed as a revolutionary dual-income marketplace for parents. The platform enables parents to earn money in two ways: (1) Get paid directly by the app for doing their own daily tasks (laundry, cooking, cleaning), and (2) Share the benefits of tasks they're already doing with neighbors for additional income. Built with a modern TypeScript stack, it features a responsive mobile interface with bottom navigation, real-time task management, earnings tracking, and a comprehensive messaging system.
