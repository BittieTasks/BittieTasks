# BittieTasks Mobile Application

## Overview
BittieTasks is a mobile-first React web application that serves as a dual-income marketplace for adults. Its primary purpose is to enable adults to earn money by sharing daily tasks with neighbors and to monetize routine activities. The platform facilitates community-based earnings, where neighbors pay to join activities, and also includes features for self-care tasks with optional accountability partners. Key capabilities include real-time task management, earnings tracking, a comprehensive messaging system, and gamified wellness achievements. The business model incorporates an advertising-based revenue model with affiliate marketing integration, an ethical partnership matching algorithm for corporate partners, a comprehensive bartering system for skill/service exchange, and an advertising management system with ethical evaluation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Senior programming engineer level technical communication.
Development workflow: Uses Replit as development workspace, GitHub for version control, and Vercel for production deployment.
