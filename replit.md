# BittieTasks Mobile Application

## Overview
BittieTasks is a mobile-first React web application designed as a dual-income marketplace for adults. Its core purpose is to facilitate community-based earnings by enabling users to monetize daily tasks and routine activities by sharing them with neighbors. The platform also supports self-care tasks with optional accountability partners. Key capabilities include real-time task management, earnings tracking, a comprehensive messaging system, and gamified wellness achievements. The business model integrates advertising, affiliate marketing, an ethical partnership matching algorithm for corporate sponsors, a comprehensive bartering system, and an advertising management system with ethical evaluation. The project aims for revenue sustainability, managing payment processing costs, and addressing taxation, with a vision for platform-funded tasks where BittieTasks directly pays for tasks from subscription and advertising revenue.
