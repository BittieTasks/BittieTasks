# Stripe Live Keys - Further Debugging

Since your keys are live, the issue is likely one of these:

## Possible Issues:

### 1. **Stripe Account Not Fully Activated**
- Your Stripe account might not be fully activated for live payments
- Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account
- Look for any warnings about "Activate your account" or missing information

### 2. **Price IDs from Wrong Environment**
- Your price IDs might be from test mode, not live mode
- In Stripe dashboard, make sure you're in "Live" mode when copying price IDs
- Check Products section in live mode

### 3. **API Key Permissions**
- Your API key might have restricted permissions
- Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
- Make sure it has full permissions (not restricted)

### 4. **Webhook Configuration Issues**
- Live webhooks must point to your live domain
- Check: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- Should point to: `https://bittietasks.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

## Immediate Test:

Since you confirmed keys are live, let's test the exact subscription creation with real authentication:

1. **Go to your site**: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe
2. **Sign in first** (make sure you're authenticated)
3. **Open browser dev tools** → Console tab
4. **Click subscription button**
5. **Copy the EXACT error message** from console

## Common Error Messages:

- **"No such price"** → Price IDs are from test mode
- **"Account not activated"** → Stripe account needs activation
- **"Restricted API key"** → API key permissions issue
- **"Invalid request"** → Missing required fields

The detailed error in your browser console will show exactly what Stripe is rejecting.

## Next Steps:
1. Test subscription button with browser console open
2. Share the exact error message
3. I'll provide the specific fix for that error
