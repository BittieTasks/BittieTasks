# WomensNet Grant Application - BittieTasks

## Business Description

BittieTasks is a community marketplace that transforms daily parenting tasks into earning opportunities while building neighborhood connections. Parents can monetize routine activities like school pickups, meal planning, and activity coordination by sharing them with neighbors who pay to join.

The platform addresses two critical challenges facing modern parents: financial stress and social isolation. Instead of traditional side hustles that conflict with family schedules, BittieTasks recognizes that parents already create value through their daily activities - we simply provide a trusted platform to share and monetize that value.

Our mobile-first platform includes safety features like background checks, a tiered subscription model (Free/Pro/Premium with decreasing platform fees), and focuses specifically on parent-friendly scheduling. Parents can earn $200-800 monthly in supplemental income while building genuine community connections with verified neighbors.

The timing is perfect - with 73 million parents in the US seeking flexible income and growing demand for local, trust-based services. BittieTasks fills the gap in the gig economy by creating parent-specific solutions that work around family life rather than competing with it.
