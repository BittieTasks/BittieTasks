# Critical Production Issues RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Stripe Build Error
**Problem**: `Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided` during build
**Solution**: Moved Stripe initialization from constructor to runtime methods
**Files**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `lib/subscription-service.ts`

### 2. ✅ Dashboard Infinite Loading  
**Problem**: Authentication loops causing continuous loading state
**Solution**: Fixed UnifiedAppRouter with immediate redirects and proper loading states
**Files**: `components/UnifiedAppRouter.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Subscription Redirect Loop
**Problem**: Subscription flow redirecting back to dashboard instead of completing
**Solution**: Fixed success page links to use proper dashboard routes
**Files**: `app/subscription/success/page.tsx`

## Deploy Commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical dashboard and subscription issues"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Clean deployment with all 3 checks passing
- ✅ Dashboard loads immediately without loops
- ✅ Subscription flow completes successfully
- ✅ Users redirect properly after payment

System now ready for live production testing!
