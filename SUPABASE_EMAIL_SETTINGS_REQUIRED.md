# Supabase Email Configuration Required

## The Issue:
Even though you have SendGrid properly set up, **Supabase is still trying to send its own verification emails** and failing.

## Solution:
You need to **disable email confirmation in Supabase dashboard** to use your custom SendGrid system.

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ttgbotlcbzmmyqawnjpj
- Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Email Auth**

### 2. Disable Supabase Email Confirmation
- **Turn OFF**: "Enable email confirmations"
- **Save** the settings

### 3. Alternative: Configure SendGrid in Supabase
If you prefer to keep email confirmation enabled:
- In the same Email Auth section
- **SMTP Settings**:
  - Host: `smtp.sendgrid.net`
  - Port: `587`
  - Username: `apikey`
  - Password: `YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY`
  - Sender email: `noreply@bittietasks.com`

## Recommendation:
**Option 1 (Fastest)**: Disable email confirmation - your custom SendGrid system handles verification beautifully

**Option 2 (Alternative)**: Configure SendGrid in Supabase SMTP settings

## Why This Happened:
- Supabase defaults to requiring email confirmation
- Your SendGrid integration is perfect, but Supabase isn't using it for auth emails
- Need to either disable Supabase emails OR configure Supabase to use SendGrid

Once you change this setting, signup will work perfectly with your SendGrid verification system!
