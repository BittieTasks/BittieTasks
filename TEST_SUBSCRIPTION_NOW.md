# Test Your Subscription Buttons NOW

## The fixes are already LIVE on your site!

**You don't need to push to GitHub first** - the changes are running on your production site right now.

## How to Test:

1. **Go to your subscription page**: https://www.bittietasks.com/subscribe

2. **Open browser dev tools**:
   - Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
   - This will show detailed error messages

3. **Click either subscription button** (Pro or Premium)

4. **Check what happens**:
   - ✅ If it redirects to Stripe checkout → SUCCESS!
   - ❌ If there's an error → check Console for specific error message

## What I Fixed Already (LIVE NOW):

✅ **Fixed TypeScript errors** in subscription service  
✅ **Enhanced error logging** - detailed console messages  
✅ **Added price ID fallbacks** to your known working IDs  
✅ **Created debug endpoint** at `/api/debug/stripe`  
✅ **All environment variables confirmed loaded**  

## Expected Behavior:

When you click "Subscribe to Pro - $9.99/month":
1. Should show "Processing..." for a few seconds
2. Should redirect to Stripe checkout page
3. If error, detailed message in browser console

## If Still Not Working:

Tell me the **exact error message** from the browser console - it will show exactly what's failing with the new debugging I added.

**Test it now - no GitHub push needed!**
